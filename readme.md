Sure, here's a sample README.md file for your object detection Flask API:

```markdown
# Object Detection Flask API

This is a Flask-based API that provides object detection functionality using a pre-trained machine learning model. Users can send an image to the API and receive a response with the detected objects and their bounding boxes.
